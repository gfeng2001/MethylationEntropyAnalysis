| June/20/2017 (Tue) | kmer counting, graph, comments |   vpn  |
| June/21/2017 (Wed) | kmer entropy | finished vpn setup |
| June/22/2017 (Thu) | kmer entropy algorithm, graphs |
| June/23/2017 (Fri) | kmer entropy algorithm, graphs completed, comments |
| June/26/2017 (Mon) | polished up kmer entropy graphs, added entropy introduction markdown |
| June/27/2017 (Tue) | Read and summarize BSMAP paper | Scheduled on-site meeting Saturday 10am |
| June/28/2017 (Wed) - June/30/2017 (Fri) | Summarized BSMAP paper and made powerpoint |
| July/1/2017 (Sat) | | Met up with Hayan at the lab, started using divergence, intro to project |
| July/3/2017 (Mon) - July/5/2017 (Wed) | Finished original functions in KL Divergence, finished Example 1 graphs |
| July/6/2017 (Thu) | Added plot points to Example 1 graphs, added functions that calculated entropy and divergence using bins for Normal and Poisson Distributions (Examples 2-6) |
| July/10/2017 (Mon) | Fixed divergence = inf case by using psuedocounting in the divergence functions, split KL divergence into 3 separate programs for each type of distribution | check in on live-scan and paperwork for working on-site |
| July/11/2017 (Tue) - July/12/2017 (Wed) | added KL graphs and finished JS Divergence function |
| July/13/2017 (Thu) - July/14/2017 (Fri) | finished JSD graphs |
| July/17/2017 (Mon) - July/21/2017 (Fri) | Started writing code to analyze the JP data files of the chromosomes, finished JSD.py file for the divergence functions and JP.py to print the divergence |
| July/24/2017 (Mon) | started running, bug fixes to JP.py |
| July/25/2017 (Tue) | finished the bash file run\_JP.sh and generated data to test files |
| July/26/2017 (Wed) | updated for faster speed by separating make\_dictionary function so it did not repeatedly run (12 hours for chrY)
| July/27/2017 (Thu) | updated for faster speed by removing unnecessary if statements and simplifying loops in JSD.py (8 hours for chrY)
| July/28/2017 (Fri) | updated for faster speed by switching to scipy coo\_matrix |
| July/31/2017 (Mon) | fixed bugs, started run with coo\_matrix (completed all chromosomes in 2 days) |
| August/1/2017 (Tue) | switched the only the set of positions that had data points in all 4 timepoints, attempted to change to numpy matrix |
| August/2/2017 (Wed) | switched back to coo\_matrix |
| August/3/2017 (Thu) | bug fixes and finalizing program with analysis, started run (completed all chromosomes in 24 hours) |
| August/4/2017 (Fri) | caught small bug involving sysargv indices in run\_JPAnalysis.sh, summer wrap-up | Access to VPN expired, Scheduling for next meeting |
